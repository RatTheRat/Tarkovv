 "about_title2" 	=> "With each day that passes irretrievably, the situation in the Norwegian region becomes more and more confused. The unceasing fighting in the streets of Tarkov has caused mass panic among the population, filling the roads leading out of it with refugees. There were, however, some locals who decided to stay, seeing in the situation an opportunity to make a profit at someone else's expense. Having accepted the new reality as a given, unorganized loners from among the inhabitants of Tarkov - the Wild Ones - began to gather in well-armed gangs, fighting with each other for the redistribution of the city. Today all of Tarkov is divided by invisible lines into zones of influence of various groups. In their thirst for profit armed bandits will stop at nothing, they are not afraid of killing civilians, nor of direct clashes with two private military companies.",
 "about_title3" 	=> "Players will have to get into the role of one of the mercenaries who survived the initial stage of the Tarkovsky conflict. After choosing one of the sides - USEC or BEAR - the player character begins his arduous journey in search of a way out of the city. The exits from Tarkov are blocked by UN peacekeepers and Russian troops, all supply lines have been cut off, and communication with the commanders has been lost. Under such circumstances, everyone must choose how to survive, what to do, and how to get out of the megalopolis plunged into an abyss of chaos.",

 "abouttext" 	=> "The events of the Escape from Tarkov take place in the fictional Norvinsk's region Special Economic Zone that became a gateway between Russia and Europe. Preferential conditions for large international companies, however, have not only attracted law-abiding businesses, but corporations of dubious intent as well. In Tarkov, one of the largest cities of the region, a transatlantic corporation became the ground zero of a political scandal. Six months later, the political standoff escalated into an armed conflict involving UN peacekeepers, Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and two private military companies. The region’s borders were sealed off, and those trapped in the middle of this local warfare flare up were isolated from the outside world.",

USEC, employed by the notorious Terra Group international corporation, vigorously engages in armed clashes, hindering the investigation of Terra Group activities, carried on by local authorities. Moreover, according to intelligence agencies, USEC provides armed cover to illegal work and research of the foreign companies, whereas BEAR, allegedly created on direct orders of the Russian government, is employed by the Norvinsk region officials to uncover any evidence of the Terra Group's illicit activities.",
